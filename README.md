# @andrea - will be making changes this evening - come back tomorrow :)

# FEDTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.1.

## Installing dependencies

Before proceeding, run `npm install` after cloning the repo, to install all necessary dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

This app's services have been written with a TDD approach. This app's components are lightly unit-tested (instantiation only).

## To-Do List (if more time):

- more intelligent spinner (currently ignores real loading time, hardcoded to 1 second)
- more responsive styling in general (add breakpoints)
- write a new feature : photo previewer - to open a modal when images are clicked on from the table
- write proper unit tests for `image-viewer.component.ts`
